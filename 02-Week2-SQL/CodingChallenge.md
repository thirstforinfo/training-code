## Challenge 1

"Fizz buzz" is a word game we will use to teach the robots about division. Let's learn computers.

* You should write a function that will receive a positive integer and return:
	* "Fizz Buzz" if the number is divisible by 3 and by 5;
	* "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3;
	* "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5; 
	* The number as a string for other cases.
**Input**: A number as an integer.

**Output**: The answer as a string.

**Precondition**: 0 < number â‰¤ 1000

1. Return the nth fibonacci number  
  f(0) = 0
  f(1) = 1
  f(10) = 55
  
```
challenge.fibonacci = function(n){
			         //code		          
                                     };
```
		_or_  
		
2. Sort array of integers  
	f([2,4,5,1,3,1]) = [1,1,2,3,4,5] 
```
	challenge.sort = function(array) {
				//code
				         };
```				    


_Don't use the Array sort() method... that would be lame.
